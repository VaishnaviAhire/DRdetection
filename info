settings.py (dr_project/settings.py)
You edited this to add:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'dr_app',
]

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
This lets Django know:
Your custom app exists.
Where to save uploaded images (media/ folder).

🔹 urls.py (project level: dr_project/urls.py)
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('dr_app.urls')),  # ⬅️ App-level routing
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
✔️ This:

Loads the routes from your app
Allows media files (images) to be served while developing

🔹 urls.py (dr_app/urls.py)
You created this file to route the homepage (/) to your view:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.upload_image, name='upload_image')
]
✔️ This ensures when user visits /, they land on the image upload form.

🔹 forms.py (dr_app/forms.py)
You created a simple Django form for uploading an image:
from django import forms

class ImageUploadForm(forms.Form):
    image = forms.ImageField()
✔️ This is the form your template uses to accept image input.

🔹 views.py (dr_app/views.py)
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import ImageUploadForm
from PIL import Image
import os

def upload_image(request):
    prediction = None
    image_url = None

    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ImageUploadForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            image = form.cleaned_data['image']
            image_path = os.path.join('media', 'image.jpg')

            with open(image_path, 'wb+') as destination:
                for chunk in image.chunks():
                    destination.write(chunk)

            # You can call your ML model here
            prediction = "Dummy Prediction: No DR Detected"

            image_url = '/media/image.jpg'

    else:
        form = ImageUploadForm()

    return render(request, 'dr_app/upload.html', {
        'form': form,
        'prediction': prediction,
        'image_url': image_url
    })
✔️ It:

Renders form on GET

Accepts image on POST

Saves image to media/

Returns a dummy prediction (you’ll connect the real ML model here later)

Passes data to template for display

🔹 upload.html (in templates/dr_app/)
This is your styled frontend form + result page.

Contains:

Card with "Detect Now" heading

File input + Submit button

Displays result and image if prediction is available

✔️ Currently includes Bootstrap for styling.

🔹 media/
Django saves uploaded files here

When a user uploads an image, it’s stored as media/image.jpg (for now)

Accessible via /media/image.jpg in browser

🧪 So What Works So Far?
✅ You have:

A working Django backend
A form that takes fundus images
An endpoint that saves the image and shows dummy prediction
A clean, styled frontend UI
